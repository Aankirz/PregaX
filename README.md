# PregaX

Welcome to Pregax, the pregnancy management app designed specifically for expectant mothers. With Pregax, you can easily plan and track your pregnancy with the help of customizable prescription reminders, informative articles, and a community chat feature.

Pregax is built using React and Tailwind for the frontend, and powered by Appwrite for the backend. To get started with Pregax, follow these steps:

```Make sure you have Node.js and npm (the Node Package Manager) installed on your machine. You can check if you have these installed by running node -v and npm -v in your terminal. If you don't have them installed, you can download the latest versions from the Node.js website (https://nodejs.org/)

Clone the Pregax repository from GitHub: git clone https://github.com/[USERNAME]/pregax.git

Navigate to the Pregax directory: cd pregax

Install the dependencies: npm install

Run the development server: npm run dev

This will start the development server and open the app in your default browser. You can now start using Pregax and exploring all of its features. If you have any issues or questions, don't hesitate to reach out to the team or open an issue on GitHub.
